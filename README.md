# Churn Prediction 📉

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn. Customer churn refers to when customers stop using a company's product or service, and predicting it can help businesses reduce customer loss.

## 📂 Project Contents
- **churn_prediction.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook with the entire pipeline:
  - Data exploration and preprocessing  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Model building and evaluation  
- *(Optional)* **data/** – Place your dataset here (not uploaded due to size/privacy).  

## 🔧 Features
- Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Data cleaning and feature selection  
- Machine learning model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Performance evaluation and visualization of results  

## 🛠 Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/churn-prediction.git
cd churn-prediction
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open **`churn_prediction.ipynb`** and run all cells.

## 📊 Outputs
- Model metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Visualizations: Churn distribution, feature importance, correlation heatmaps
